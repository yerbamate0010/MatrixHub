# Hygienic Sleep

This document describes the current hygiene-sleep implementation, not a wishlist of possible optimizations.

In this project, "hygienic sleep" means a very short deep-sleep cycle used to reset DRAM-heavy runtime state while preserving RTC-backed configuration and diagnostics.

## Why it exists

The main reason is heap health:

- internal RAM fragmentation can make TLS and other allocations unreliable
- a short deep-sleep cycle clears volatile runtime state
- RTC-backed configuration, counters, and caches survive the sleep/wake cycle

This is part of the normal power-management path. It is not a separate reboot mechanism.

## Entry points

### Manual trigger

Admin HTTP endpoint:

- `POST /rest/power/hygieneSleep`

Current behavior:

- the handler replies `200`
- waits briefly so the HTTP response can flush
- marks `RTC::runtimeStats.hygieneSleepActive`
- sets wake interval to `100ms`
- requests sleep through `PowerManager`

### Automatic trigger

`HeapMonitor::checkHygieneConditions()` can request hygiene sleep when:

- the largest internal free block drops below the configured threshold
- or fragmentation stays too high for a sustained period

Automatic hygiene sleep also:

- records `ShutdownReason::HYGIENE_SLEEP` in `BootTracker`
- increments `RTC::runtimeStats.hygieneSleepCount`
- updates `RTC::runtimeStats.lastHygieneSleepMs`

### Related maintenance sleep

The `hygieneSleepActive` flag is also reused by some maintenance/recovery paths, for example thermal emergency cooling sleep. Do not treat that flag as "heap fragmentation only".

## Actual sleep flow

Once sleep is requested, the path is:

1. `PowerSleepController::requestSleep(...)`
2. `PowerSleepController::enterDeepSleep(...)`
3. `SleepService::executeSleepCallbacks()`
4. pre-sleep hook from `ShutdownSequence::execute()`
5. wake-source configuration
6. `RTC::prepareForSleep()`
7. `esp_deep_sleep_start()`

`ShutdownSequence` currently does the heavy lifting before the chip actually sleeps.

## What `ShutdownSequence` stops

Before sleep, the shutdown path currently stops or soft-stops:

- `NotificationWorker`
- `WifiSensingService`
- `AirMouseService`
- `MacroService`
- `SensorLoggingTask`
- `ShellyService`
- `MatrixTask`
- `ThermalMonitor`
- BLE via `BleService::prepareForSleep()`
- Wi-Fi radio via `WiFi.mode(WIFI_OFF)`

It also persists RTC/boot state and flushes serial output.

## What is intentionally *not* done

Some older ideas were removed from this document because they are not part of the current design.

Notably:

- no dedicated pre-sleep `TelegramClient::disconnect()` step
- no explicit `server->stop()` during shutdown
- no `MDNS.end()` in the shutdown path
- no `Wire.end()` before deep sleep
- no full NimBLE deinit before sleep

Those omissions are intentional. The current code prefers a reliable, non-blocking shutdown path over aggressive cleanup that previously caused hangs or instability.

## State that survives

Hygiene sleep relies on RTC-backed state surviving the cycle, including:

- configuration stored in `RTC::ConfigStore`
- runtime stats such as `hygieneSleepActive`, `hygieneSleepCount`, `telegramLastUpdateId`
- heap history and diagnostics
- BLE / sensor / network caches kept in RTC structures
- boot-tracking metadata

## Practical validation

Minimal validation flow:

1. call `POST /rest/power/hygieneSleep`
2. observe a short sleep/wake cycle on serial logs
3. confirm the device returns quickly
4. inspect counters such as `RTC::runtimeStats.hygieneSleepCount` or health output after wake

If hygiene sleep is failing, the most likely problems are in the shutdown path, wake-source configuration, or RTC persistence, not in Telegram/Webhook-specific cleanup.
