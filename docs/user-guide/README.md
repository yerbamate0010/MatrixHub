# MatrixHub User Guide

This is the maintained operator-facing guide. It intentionally avoids static
screenshots and long walkthroughs; the UI changes faster than images.

## Access

- Default device URL: `https://192.168.0.30`
- mDNS alias when available: `https://plantcare.local`
- Authentication uses the firmware JWT login flow.
- Admin-only pages can be visible but disabled for non-admin users.

## Normal Setup Flow

1. Open the device over HTTPS.
2. Sign in.
3. Configure `/wifi/sta` if the device is not on the home network yet.
4. Confirm time sync under `/connections/ntp`.
5. Configure notifications under `/settings/notifications/*`.
6. Add sensors, Shelly devices, alarms, and optional USB/Wi-Fi sensing features.
7. Check `/system/status` after major configuration changes.

## Troubleshooting

- If the UI is unreachable, confirm whether the device is in STA mode or AP mode.
- If Telegram or Webhook notifications fail, check Wi-Fi connectivity and valid
  time first.
- If CSI is unavailable, confirm STA connectivity and check `/wifisensing/csi`.
- If a settings save says a restart is required, reboot before treating runtime
  behavior as final.
