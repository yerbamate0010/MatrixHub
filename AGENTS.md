# AGENTS.md

These instructions apply to the whole repository.

## Role And Language

- Work as an ESP32-S3 firmware and SvelteKit UI agent for MatrixHub.
- Chat with the user in Polish. Keep code, identifiers, comments, logs, commit
  messages, and commands in English unless the existing file uses Polish.
- Target board/env: Waveshare ESP32-S3 Matrix, PlatformIO env
  `waveshare_esp32s3_matrix`.
- The firmware uses the Arduino framework on the pioarduino ESP32 platform, plus
  ESP-IDF/FreeRTOS APIs where the codebase already uses them.
- The UI is in `interface/` and is embedded into firmware through
  `scripts/build/build_interface.py`.

## Hard Rules

- Do not modify `lib/framework/` unless the user explicitly asks for framework
  changes or the change is unavoidable and explained.
- Do not modify `src/wifisensing/csi/vendor/` or the prebuilt CSI vendor library
  unless the user explicitly asks for vendor work.
- Do not change firmware logic when the task is about build speed, tooling,
  documentation, or PlatformIO workflow.
- Respect the existing dirty tree. Do not revert user changes or generated files
  you did not intentionally touch.
- Keep edits scoped. Prefer existing local patterns over new abstractions.
- For host-only code, use the `native` env and keep it under `src/native/` or
  `test/`. `src/native/**` is intentionally excluded from the ESP32 env.

## Build Workflow

Prefer the helper scripts because they handle the local PlatformIO path and the
optimized build settings.

| Area | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fast firmware build | `./scripts/build-fast.sh` | Preferred iteration path. Uses `waveshare_esp32s3_matrix_dev`, skips UI, defaults to `-j4`. |
| Clean main env | `./scripts/build-clean.sh` | Cleans only `waveshare_esp32s3_matrix`; the next build should reuse `.pio/cache` when signatures match. |
| Rebuild diagnosis | `./scripts/build-explain.sh` | Writes `build-explain.log` using SCons `--debug=explain`. |
| Native tests | `pio test -e native` | Use `$HOME/.platformio/penv/bin/pio` if `pio` is not in PATH. |
| Full release build | `pio run -e waveshare_esp32s3_matrix` | Builds UI and firmware. Use for final artifacts or UI embed changes. |
| Upload | `pio run -e waveshare_esp32s3_matrix -t upload` | Stop any active monitor first. |
| Monitor | `pio device monitor` | Use after flashing to inspect runtime logs. |

Build speed facts measured on the Raspberry Pi 5 host:

- A cold full build can take about 15 minutes.
- A normal no-change build is about 38-40 seconds.
- With `.pio/cache` warmed, recreating a clean build directory is about
  50 seconds instead of recompiling everything.
- Do not run repeated cold clean builds unless the task specifically requires
  timing cache invalidation or PlatformIO/SCons behavior.
- The main env uses `lib_ldf_mode = chain`. Do not switch to `deep` or `deep+`
  before checking missing includes and explicit `lib_deps`.

## Project Shape

Important entry path:

- `src/main.cpp`
- `src/system/Application.cpp`
- `src/system/init/core/InitSequence.cpp`
- `src/system/services/ServiceRegistry*.cpp`
- `src/system/init/services/*Initializer.*`

Configuration and state:

- `src/config/System.h` is the aggregate include for system config.
- `src/config/TaskConfig.h` owns task stack sizes, priorities, core affinity,
  timeouts, and task monitoring thresholds.
- `src/config/App.h`, `src/config/Hardware.h`, and `src/config/Network.h` hold
  app, board, hardware, and network constants.
- Runtime JSON config serialization lives in `src/config/json/`.
- RTC-backed persistent structs live in `src/system/rtc/types/`.
- Increment `RTC::kSchemaVersion` in `src/system/rtc/RtcConfig.h` when changing
  RTC struct layout.

Core module directories:

- `src/api/`: HTTP and WebSocket API controllers.
- `src/system/`: boot, lifecycle, service registry, logging, memory, power,
  watchdog, health, RTC, and shutdown.
- `src/notifications/telegram/`: Telegram client, commands, queue, polling, and
  worker runtime. There is no standalone `src/telegram/` module.
- `src/udp/`: UDP pusher and settings.
- `src/wifisensing/`: RSSI and CSI sensing.
- `src/ble/`: BLE facade, scanning, parsing, and BLE settings.
- `src/alarms/`, `src/shelly/`, `src/sensors/`, `src/matrix/`,
  `src/keyboard/`, `src/macros/`, `src/airmouse/`, `src/usb_terminal/`, and
  `src/compensation/`: domain services and settings.
- `interface/src/`: SvelteKit UI routes, services, stores, components, types,
  and tests.

## Architecture Rules

- Services are owned by `ServiceRegistry` and wired during boot through the
  initializer classes under `src/system/init/services/`.
- Keep API classes in `src/api/*` transport-focused: parse requests, call
  services, and serialize responses. Put business logic in the domain service.
- Prefer explicit dependency injection through `begin()` or constructors. Avoid
  adding new global `extern` dependencies.
- Register new long-lived services in `ServiceRegistry` and document ownership
  or shutdown implications when they matter.
- Keep task stack sizes, priorities, and core choices in `CONFIG::TASKS`; do not
  hardcode `xTaskCreate*` parameters inline.
- Use `/rest/...` for framework/system-style endpoints and `/api/...` for domain
  endpoints, matching existing routing.

## Memory And Concurrency

- Default to PSRAM for large non-DMA, non-ISR buffers. As a rule of thumb,
  temporary user-space buffers over 512 bytes should use PSRAM.
- Use internal DRAM for DMA buffers, ISR-accessed data, and latency-critical
  small structures.
- Use `SYSTEM::SpiRamJsonDocument` for large JSON documents and stream large API
  responses in chunks instead of building huge `String` objects.
- Use `heap_caps_free()` for memory allocated with `heap_caps_malloc()`.
- Avoid long-lived Arduino `String` objects in services, large buffers, and
  persistent data. Prefer fixed `char[]`, `std::string` with project allocators,
  or existing PSRAM helpers.
- ISR callbacks must not allocate, block, log heavily, or take mutexes. Use
  fixed-size data and FreeRTOS ISR-safe queue calls.
- For CSI, keep the callback path minimal and pass `CsiPacket` data to worker
  tasks through the existing queue path in `src/wifisensing/csi/data/`.

## UI And Generated Files

- `scripts/build/build_interface.py` already avoids rewriting
  `lib/framework/core/WWWData.h` when content is unchanged. Preserve that
  behavior.
- If adding a generator, write generated files only when bytes actually differ.
  Avoid timestamp-only headers that invalidate half the firmware.
- Use `custom_skip_ui = yes` or `SKIP_UI=1` only for developer firmware
  iteration. Full release builds must embed the UI.

## Testing Guidance

- For firmware logic that can run on host, add or update `pio test -e native`
  coverage.
- For ESP32-only behavior, keep tests focused and explain what was verified by
  build, logs, or static inspection.
- For UI changes, follow the existing `interface/` test/build workflow. Do not
  rebuild the UI during firmware-only work unless the UI embed is part of the
  task.

## Git Notes

- Keep commits focused and do not include unrelated user changes.
- This repo may be ahead of `origin/main` if GitHub HTTPS authentication is not
  configured. If `git push` fails with a username/auth error, report it instead
  of rewriting remotes or history.
